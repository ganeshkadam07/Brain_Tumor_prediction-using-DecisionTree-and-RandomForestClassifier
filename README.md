## Installation

1. Clone the repository:h
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation:

Ensure that your brain tumor dataset is in the appropriate format.
Preprocess the data if needed, such as handling missing values or encoding categorical variables.
Model Training:

Run the training script to train a Decision Tree Classifier:

python train_decision_tree.py --data_path path/to/training_data.csv
Adjust the hyperparameters and preprocessing steps based on your dataset and requirements.

Run the training script to train a RandomForest Classifier:

python train_random_forest.py --data_path path/to/training_data.csv
Customize the parameters and preprocessing steps according to your dataset and preferences.

Model Evaluation:

Use the trained models to make predictions and evaluate their performance:


python evaluate_models.py --decision_tree_model_path path/to/decision_tree_model.pkl --random_forest_model_path path/to/random_forest_model.pkl --test_data_path path/to/test_data.csv
Replace the paths with the appropriate locations of your trained models and test dataset.

Interpretation and Prediction:

Analyze the evaluation results to assess the models' performance.
Utilize the trained models to predict brain tumor presence on new, unseen data.
Data
The brain tumor dataset used in this project can be found in the data directory. Ensure that your dataset follows the required format and includes relevant features for accurate prediction.
